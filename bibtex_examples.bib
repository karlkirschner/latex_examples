  Abstract                 = {2-Haloethanol and 2-haloethylamine (halogen = F{,} Cl) prefer gauche conformation. This preference is significantly increased upon protonation. Commonly used explanations are based on intramolecular hydrogen bonding and hyperconjugation. 1{,}2-Difluoroethane prefers gauche conformation{,} too{,} while gaseous 1-chloro-2-fluoroethane is more stable as the anti conformer. The origin of these conformational preferences has been investigated by a quantitative partitioning of the gauche/anti energy difference into contributions from electrostatic{,} orbital{,} dispersion and Pauli interactions{,} and structural changes accompanying the rotation. The results show that{,} with two exceptions{,} the most important contributor to the gauche preference is electrostatic attraction{,} which is larger in gauche forms relative to the anti ones. Next come orbital interactions{,} while dispersion forces provide the smallest stabilizing energy. These energy components override destabilizing Pauli interactions and energetically costly structural changes. All gauche preferences also benefit from stereoelectronic effects{,} except in protonated 2-chloroethanol which{,} instead{,} shows a significant Cl lone pair [rightward arrow] O-H antibond mixing{,} associated with hydrogen bonding. The increase in the Pauli repulsion upon anti to gauche isomerization is more pronounced for fluorine than for chlorine derivatives. Thus{,} the smaller gauche effect in chloro-compounds and the anti preference in 1-chloro-2-fluoroethane have their origin in the decrease in electrostatic and orbital stabilizing interactions{,} a drop in the former being more pronounced.},
